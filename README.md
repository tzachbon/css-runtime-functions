# CSS Runtime Functions

Made with CSS Houdini.
This is my experiment with CSS Houdini and the paint API.

CSS Properties cannot be changed dynamically and it is a bummer.
Therefore a lot of people go to build time variables and formatters with CSS preprocessor which is the most convenient solution at the moment.


I created here nice example for a "runtime" formatter (or function if you like) that can change your runtime property dynamically.
The only problem is that the solution right now is using the `paint` API and it could only be used on properties like "background-image" or it's shorthands.

I would really love if something like [this](https://github.com/w3c/css-houdini-drafts/issues/1007) could exists and make our like more simple.
